# Data Collection Protocol

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the standardized protocol for collecting sensor data from study subjects in our sleep tracking device R&D project. The primary goal is to gather comprehensive, multi-sensor physiological data during sleep under real-world conditions. This protocol describes subject recruitment, sensor equipment, device placement, and data collection procedures to ensure consistent, high-quality data capture across all participants.


## 2. Sensor Suite and Equipment

### Core Sensor Package (to be integrated into the unified device):

- **Accelerometer:** For detecting body motion and orientation.
- **Gyroscope:** For tracking rotational movement.
- **Photoplethysmography (PPG):** For measuring heart rate and blood oxygen saturation.

### Optional Sensor Modules (if included in a given prototype):

- **Electrodermal Activity (EDA):** For assessing skin conductance as an indicator of stress/arousal.
- **Temperature Sensor:** To monitor skin/ambient temperature.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** For more precise heart rate monitoring and heart rate variability (HRV).
- **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** For direct measurement of brain activity (primarily as a reference signal).

### Reference Device:

- An EEG monitor and/or a commercially available sleep tracking device will serve as ground-truth for labeling our sleep data epochs.
