Based on the search results, two EEG headbands stand out for providing accurate sleep stage data:

1. Muse S Gen 2 Headband:
- Achieves 86% accuracy in identifying different sleep stages[6]
- Shows good agreement with sleep experts, with a Cohen's kappa score of approximately 0.78 for five sleep stages[6]
- Provides accurate data on sleep stages, time awake/asleep, sleep latency, and head position when worn correctly[2][8]

2. Dreem Headband (DH):
- Reaches an overall accuracy of 83.5 ± 6.4% for automatic sleep staging[3]
- Demonstrates strong correlation with polysomnography (PSG) for monitoring alpha, beta, delta, and theta frequencies during sleep[3]
- Shows acceptable performance for sleep/wake classification (MCC=0.77±0.17) and moderate performance for 5-stage sleep classification (MCC=0.54±0.14)[7]

Both devices offer significant improvements over non-EEG sleep trackers, with the Muse S Gen 2 slightly outperforming the Dreem Headband in terms of reported accuracy. These EEG headbands provide a more accessible and comfortable alternative to traditional polysomnography for home sleep monitoring[9].
