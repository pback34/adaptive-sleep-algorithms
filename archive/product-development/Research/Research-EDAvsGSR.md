**Electrodermal Activity (EDA)** and **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)** are closely related terms that describe the measurement of electrical properties of the skin, but they differ slightly in scope and usage. Here's a detailed explanation of their relationship and differences:

---

### **1. Relationship Between EDA and GSR**
- **EDA** is the broader term that encompasses all electrical phenomena occurring on the skin. It refers to changes in the skin's electrical properties due to sweat gland activity, which is controlled by the **sympathetic nervous system (SNS)**.
- **GSR** is a specific method or subset of EDA that measures changes in skin conductance or resistance caused by sweat secretion. It is often used interchangeably with EDA but is technically a more focused term.

In essence, **GSR is one way to measure EDA**, typically by applying a small current to the skin and measuring changes in conductance or resistance.

### **2. Differences Between EDA and GSR**

| **Aspect**                | **EDA (Electrodermal Activity)**                           | **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)**                       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | A broad term for all electrical phenomena of the skin.    | A specific method for measuring skin conductance or resistance. |
| **Measurement Focus**     | Encompasses both tonic (baseline) and phasic (stimulus-driven) components of skin activity. | Typically focuses on phasic responses to stimuli (e.g., emotional arousal). |
| **Units Measured**        | Skin conductance (microsiemens, µS), skin resistance (ohms), or potential (volts). | Usually measures either conductance (µS) or resistance (ohms). |
| **Methodology**           | Includes multiple techniques like conductance, resistance, or voltage measurement. | Primarily involves applying a small current to measure conductance/resistance changes. |
| **Applications**          | Broader applications in psychophysiology, stress research, sleep studies, and emotion tracking. | Commonly used in lie detection, emotional response studies, and biofeedback. |

### **3. Components of EDA**
EDA can be broken down into two main components:
- **Tonic Component**:
  - Refers to the baseline level of skin conductance.
  - Changes slowly over time and reflects general physiological arousal or stress levels.
  - Example: Higher tonic levels during sustained stress or anxiety.

- **Phasic Component**:
  - Refers to rapid, stimulus-driven changes in skin conductance known as Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs).
  - Linked to specific events like emotional arousal, cognitive effort, or sensory stimuli.
  - Example: A sudden SCR when startled by a loud noise.

GSR typically measures these phasic responses but does not always account for tonic activity.

### **4. Historical Context**
- The term "Galvanic Skin Response" comes from early studies using galvanometers to measure electrical resistance of the skin.
- Over time, researchers adopted "Electrodermal Activity" as a broader term to reflect advancements in understanding and measurement techniques.

---

### **5. Practical Implications**
- In modern research and applications:
  - The term **EDA** is more commonly used in scientific literature because it encompasses all aspects of skin electrical activity.
  - The term **GSR** is still widely recognized in applied settings like polygraph testing or biofeedback devices but may be considered less precise scientifically.

---

### Conclusion
EDA is the umbrella term for all electrical phenomena of the skin, while GSR refers specifically to measuring changes in skin conductance or resistance caused by sweat gland activity. GSR is essentially a method within the broader field of EDA measurement. In practice, both terms are often used interchangeably, but EDA is preferred in modern scientific contexts due to its broader scope.
