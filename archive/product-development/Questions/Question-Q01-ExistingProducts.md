## Report 1
### Real-Time Sleep State Tracking Wearables in 2025

Several advanced wearable devices now offer real-time or near-real-time sleep state tracking capabilities, providing users with immediate insights into their sleep patterns and quality. This report summarizes the key features and capabilities of the leading sleep monitoring wearables available in 2025 that offer true real-time tracking.

#### Oura Ring 4

The Oura Ring 4 features a new "smart sensing" system that enables it to capture data more accurately with fewer gaps throughout the day and night. This is achieved through a new algorithm that adapts to specific fingers and the addition of more signal pathways for gathering data. An external research study conducted by Oura in August found that the new system resulted in a 7% decrease in daytime heart rate gaps.[1]

The Oura Ring 4 offers detailed sleep analysis with 24/7 heart rate tracking, including during sleep. It provides advanced temperature monitoring and blood oxygen sensing (SpO2). The ring's ability to continuously monitor these metrics allows for near-real-time sleep state detection. Once you pair your new Oura Ring 4, you'll see all your data in the Oura App, providing quick access to your sleep information.[15]

#### WHOOP 4.0

The WHOOP 4.0 tracks all four stages of sleep - Slow Wave Sleep (SWS), REM, light sleep, and awake - with high accuracy. It monitors your waking events, skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability (HRV) throughout the night.[3]

The WHOOP 4.0 features an upgraded sensor configuration with 5 LEDs (three green, one red, and one infrared) and 4 photodiodes for enhanced accuracy. It also includes haptic technology for gentle, vibration-based wake-ups and a pulse oximeter to measure blood oxygen levels.[5] These features allow for real-time sleep state detection and immediate feedback.

#### Muse S Headband

The Muse S headband uses EEG sensors to monitor brain activity, giving a more accurate picture of sleep compared to other devices. In addition to brain activity, it monitors heart rate, respiratory rate, the amount of time spent sleeping and awake, sleep latency, and the number of times you change sleep positions during the night. The device's Digital Sleeping Pill (DSP) feature uses real-time brain activity monitoring to adjust audio programs based on your sleep state, demonstrating its capability for immediate sleep stage detection.[4]

The Muse S offers a personalized meditation experience by translating brain signals into soothing soundscapes in real-time. Its advanced sleep-tracking capabilities provide valuable insights into sleep patterns, aiding in optimizing sleep cycles as they occur.[20]

#### Apple Watch Series 10

The Apple Watch Series 10 introduces a new sleep apnea monitoring capability that leverages the device's accelerometer to capture "real-time, motion-based" information. It can identify when a user experiences periods of disrupted or restless sleep. When combined with additional real-time health sensors, the watch will alert users if it detects consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea.[2]

With the Sleep app on Apple Watch, you can create sleep schedules to help you meet your sleep goals. The watch can estimate the time you spent in each sleep stage—REM, Core, and Deep—as well as when you might have woken up. When you wake up, you can immediately open the Sleep app to learn how much sleep you got.[16]

These devices represent the cutting edge of consumer sleep tracking technology in 2025, offering users the ability to monitor their sleep patterns with unprecedented detail and immediacy. They provide real-time or near-real-time insights into sleep states, allowing users to understand their sleep patterns as they occur, rather than relying solely on post-sleep analysis.
