## Proposals

### Proposal for Phase 1 data collection
*by Peter Backeris*

With a sensing module described in [[Task-P01-01-DecideSignals]], we can collect signals from the following locations using different attachment apparatuses:
- Wrist (using off-the-shelf Air Pod or Tile silicone wrist bands)
- Chest, Waist (using custom magnetic garment-pinching button modules)
- Thigh (using custom band)
- Foot (using custom sock with pouch)
