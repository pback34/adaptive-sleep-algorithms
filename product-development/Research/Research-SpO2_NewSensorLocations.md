There are several wrist-worn pulse oximeters that can accurately measure SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) levels. These devices have become increasingly sophisticated and reliable in recent years, offering continuous monitoring capabilities and additional features.

## Notable Wrist-Worn Pulse Oximeters

### Philips WristOx2

The Philips WristOx2 is an FDA-approved oximeter designed for continuous oxygen monitoring[3]. It offers:

- Long-lasting battery life
- Enhanced memory for extended data collection
- Bluetooth connectivity (in some models)

While primarily intended for professional healthcare settings, it's considered one of the best options for continuous monitoring.

### Wellue SleepU

The Wellue SleepU is a compact wrist-worn oxygen monitor specifically designed for overnight use[5]. Key features include:

- Continuous recording of SpO2, pulse rate, and body movements
- Vibration alerts for low oxygen levels
- Up to 16 hours of battery life
- Companion app for data analysis and reporting

### Checkme O2 Wrist Oxygen Monitor

This device offers comprehensive monitoring capabilities[6]:

- Continuous tracking of oxygen levels and pulse rates for up to 7 nights
- Smart alerts when oxygen levels drop below a preset threshold
- 72-hour battery life
- Data storage for up to 4 sessions (10 hours each)
- Companion app and PC software for detailed analysis

## Accuracy Considerations

While wrist-worn pulse oximeters have improved significantly, it's important to note that accuracy can vary:

- A study on the Garmin fēnix 5X Plus watch found that it exhibited minimal overestimation of SpO2 under most conditions, with larger discrepancies only at simulated high altitudes (12,000 ft)[7].
- Epson has developed an SDK for biological measurements that supports SpO2 readings on various body parts, including the wrist, potentially improving future device accuracy[10].

## Conclusion

Wrist-worn pulse oximeters capable of accurately measuring SpO2 are now available for both consumer and medical use. While they may not match the precision of medical-grade fingertip devices in all scenarios, they offer the significant advantage of continuous, long-term monitoring, especially during sleep. For those requiring regular SpO2 tracking, these wearable devices provide a convenient and increasingly reliable option.
