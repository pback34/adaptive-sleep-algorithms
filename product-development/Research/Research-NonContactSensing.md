## iSleepPad 

The iSleePad, unveiled at CES 2025, employs advanced non-contact sensing technology to monitor sleep metrics without requiring physical contact with the user. Here’s how its key components work together:

### **Low Power Microwave Sensor (LPMS) Technology**  
The core of the iSleePad is its LPMS system, which uses **μW Doppler microwaves** to detect vital signs like **heart rate** and **breathing patterns** by analyzing phase changes in transmitted and received signals[1][3][4]. This contactless approach operates at a power level **1,000 times lower than a smartphone’s transmission**, ensuring safety and minimizing health risks[1][9]. The sensor has a detection range of up to **15 cm** and is embedded in a thin pad placed beneath bedding, eliminating the need for wearable devices or adhesive patches[1][4].

### **Flexible Pressure-Sensitive Antenna**  
To track **sleep position** and movement, the iSleePad integrates a **pressure-sensitive flexible antenna** that detects multiple pressure points across the pad. This system achieves **over 95% accuracy** in identifying bed exits or abnormal movements, making it particularly useful for elderly users or those requiring fall prevention[1][3]. Real-time alerts are sent to caregivers via the companion app if sudden position changes occur[3][4].

### **Schumann Resonance Generator**  
The pad includes a **Schumann wave generator** that emits low-frequency electromagnetic waves (7.83 Hz) to synchronize with the body’s natural rhythms, promoting deeper sleep and relaxation[1][3][4]. This feature is designed to create a calming environment without direct physical intervention.

### **Data Integration and Usability**  
- **Multi-person management**: The app supports simultaneous monitoring of multiple users, ideal for care facilities or families[1][3].  
- **Real-time analytics**: Vital signs and sleep stages are displayed in real time, with long-term trends stored for health tracking[1][9].  
- **Portability**: The pad is lightweight, foldable, and compatible with existing mattresses, ensuring minimal disruption to sleep comfort[1][4].  

By combining microwave sensing, pressure detection, and bio-resonance technology, the iSleePad offers a comprehensive, non-intrusive solution for both home and medical sleep monitoring[1][3][9]. Its energy-efficient design and scalability address global challenges in sleep healthcare, catering to users across all age groups[1][4].
