## Week of *25.03.06*

This week will focus on core infrastructure for data ingestion and visualization, as well as initial exploration of random forests algorithms applied to heart rate and accel data (starting with just accel using open-source libraries)
### In-progress/To-do
-  Working on [[Task-P2.2-03-TestingOpenSourceLibraries]]
	- Tested Asleep (poor results)
	- Testing Random Forests algorithm next, based on: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79217-x
		- [Github](https://github.com/wadpac/Sundararajan-SleepClassification-2021?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Refine data ingestion infrastructure
	- Polar H10/Verity Sense sensor data
	- Stuart's accel data
	- Public data sources (TBD)
	- Sleep Stage Labeling from Enchanted Wave (other TBD)
- Data Visualization
	- Plot key metrics in 30-sec epochs
	- Integrate labeling from enchanted wave
